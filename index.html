          <li>This chart shows the relationship between the percent of adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and social vulnerability by United States county. Data is from <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-County-and-local-es/q9mh-h2tw/data">the CDC</a> and is accurate as of 6/10/2021.

          <li>According to the CDC, social vulnerability refers to the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health. Such stresses include natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks. Reducing social vulnerability can decrease both human suffering and economic loss.
